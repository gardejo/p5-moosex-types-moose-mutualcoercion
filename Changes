VERSION HISTORY
===============

0.04 : Released on 2013-12-25 (JST)
-----------------------------------

### Bug fixes

#### Following recent Moose

-   Replaced `load_class()` and `is_class_loaded()` functions from
    `Class::MOP` module as an internally-used class loader with namesake
    functions from `Class::Load` module.
    It intended to follow recent Moose (2.1200).
    It is concerned with RT #90911 (by Upasana Shukla).
    Thank you for your contributions.

#### Packaging

-   The package no longer includes test modules.
    They caused a failure of the tests.
    It is concerned with RT #89913 (by Poul Henning Sørensen), #91051
    (by Slaven Rezić) and #91581 (by Caleb Cushing).
    Thank you for your contributions.
